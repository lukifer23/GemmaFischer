## Q2: Explain the concept of zugzwang and give a short example.

### Original model answer:

**Explanation:**

*   **Zugzwang:** A restriction on the amount of time or effort that a person can commit to a particular activity. It's a condition that must be met before a person can continue.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Zugzwang:** A person cannot work for 10 hours in a day.
    *   **Example:** A person can only work for 2 hours in a day.

**Explanation:**

*   **Zugzwang:** A limit on the amount of time or effort that a person can commit to a particular activity. It's a condition that must be met before a person can continue.
*   **Example:** A person can only work for 2 hours in a day.

**In summary:**

Zugzwang is a fundamental concept in psychology and sociology that describes the limitations placed on a person's capacity to engage in a particular activity. It's a crucial element

### Current model answer:

**Explanation:**

*   **Zugzwang:**  A condition that must be met to proceed with a process or activity.  It's a key factor in determining the scope of a task.
*   **Example:**  "The project is due on Friday, but the deadline is 10:00 AM."  This means that the project can proceed with the initial steps, but it's not possible to complete it all at once.  The task is not completed until the project is finished.

**d2d4**  (d2d4 is a very common and important example of zugzwang)

**d7d5**  (d1e2)  This is a very important example of zugzwang.  It means that the process can be broken down into smaller steps.  If the process is broken down into steps, it's possible to complete the process.  This is a key principle of computer science
