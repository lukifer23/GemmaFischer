```bash
# Train all experts with automatic resume and validation
python -m src.training.train_chessgemmma

# Train specific experts only
python -m src.training.train_chessgemmma --experts uci tutor

# Fresh training (no checkpoint resume)
python -m src.training.train_chessgemmma --no-resume

# Training with comprehensive validation
python -m src.training.train_chessgemmma --validate
```

- âœ… **Comprehensive Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates and ETA calculations
- âœ… **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure handling and detailed error reporting
- âœ… **Post-Training Validation**: Automated performance benchmarking

### Prerequisites

- **Mac with M3 Pro chip** (required for optimal MPS performance)
- Python 3.10+
- 16GB+ RAM (recommended for training)
- Stockfish chess engine (optional, for advanced features)
- macOS 12.0+ (for MPS support)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup environment:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukifer23/GemmaFischer.git
cd GemmaFischer
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install Stockfish (optional):**
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install stockfish

# Or download from https://stockfishchess.org/download/
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Run inference (programmatic):**
```bash
python -c "from src.inference.inference import load_model,run_inference;print('load:',load_model());print(run_inference('Explain castling in chess')['response'])"
```

2. **Start web interface:**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/web/app.py
# Visit http://localhost:5001 (includes training controls and real-time monitoring)
```

3. **Run training (smoke test):**
```bash
python src/training/train.py --do_train --max_steps 10
```

### Expert Training (Current Setup)

The system supports multiple specialized expert models. Current available datasets:

```bash
# UCI Expert (50,000 samples) - Chess move generation
python src/training/train_lora_poc.py --expert uci --config auto --max_steps_override 1000 --disable_eval

# Tutor Expert (50,000 samples) - Chess explanations and analysis
python src/training/train_lora_poc.py --expert tutor --config auto --max_steps_override 1000 --disable_eval

# Director Expert (3.2MB) - Chess Q&A and reasoning
python src/training/train_lora_poc.py --expert director --config auto --max_steps_override 1000 --disable_eval
```

All experts write checkpoints to `checkpoints/lora_{expert_name}` and support live adapter switching in the web interface.

4. **Stockfish match evaluator (optional):**
```bash
# Evaluate model vs Stockfish on mixed FENs
python src/evaluation/stockfish_match_eval.py --file data/datasets/eval_mixed_positions_200.jsonl --limit 100 --depth 12 --out stockfish_match_after.json

# Evaluate tactical puzzle first-move accuracy
python src/evaluation/puzzle_eval.py --file data/datasets/lichess_puzzles_1000_2000.jsonl --limit 200 --out eval_report_after.json
```

Tip: set `CHESSGEMMA_ENGINE_RERANK=0` to disable N-best re-ranking for lower latency engine mode.

## Longer Training (Moderate)

Recommended order:
1) Optional data cleaning (improves legality and labels)
2) Run longer expert training runs sequentially

Data cleaning (creates cleaned JSONL; `ln -sf` makes a symlink so configs keep working without edits):

```bash
# UCI: validate and repair labels with Stockfish, then point the formatted path at the cleaned file
python data/scripts/validate_and_augment.py --in data/formatted/uci_expert.jsonl --out data/processed/uci_clean.jsonl --mode uci --relabel_with_stockfish
ln -sf data/processed/uci_clean.jsonl data/formatted/uci_expert.jsonl

# Tutor: enforce trailing "Best move: <uci>" line; repair with Stockfish when possible
python data/scripts/validate_and_augment.py --in data/formatted/tutor_expert.jsonl --out data/processed/tutor_clean.jsonl --mode tutor --relabel_with_stockfish
ln -sf data/processed/tutor_clean.jsonl data/formatted/tutor_expert.jsonl
```

Notes:
- `ln -sf` creates a symlink (`-s`) and overwrites existing files (`-f`). It makes `data/formatted/...` point to the cleaned file without changing configs.
- If you prefer not to use symlinks, edit the training configs to reference the cleaned files directly.

Longer (moderate) training runs (sequential):

```bash
# UCI adapter (~1000 steps)
python src/training/train_lora_poc.py --expert uci --config auto --max_steps_override 1000 --disable_eval

# Tutor adapter (~1500 steps)
python src/training/train_lora_poc.py --expert tutor --config auto --max_steps_override 1500 --use_instruction_collator --disable_eval

# Director adapter (~1000 steps)
python src/training/train_lora_poc.py --expert director --config auto --max_steps_override 1000 --use_instruction_collator --disable_eval
```

## Web Interface (Active)

## Performance

### Training Performance (M3 Pro)

- **Memory Usage**: ~4-6GB (MPS-optimized)
- **Training Speed**: ~2-3 steps/second on M3 Pro
- **Convergence**: Loss typically drops from 3.0 to 1.2 in 100 steps
- **MPS Acceleration**: All operations use Metal Performance Shaders
- **No CUDA/CPU Fallbacks**: Optimized exclusively for Apple Silicon

### Model Performance

- **Chess Relevance**: ~85% for chess-specific questions
- **Move Accuracy**: ~70% for basic chess moves
- **Response Quality**: Improved over base model

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (M3 Pro)

1. **MPS not available:**
   ```bash
   # Check MPS availability (should be True on M3 Pro)
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())"
   ```

2. **Out of memory:**
   - Reduce batch size in config
   - Enable gradient checkpointing
   - Reduce LoRA rank if needed

3. **Stockfish not found:**
   ```bash
   # Install Stockfish
   brew install stockfish
   # Or set custom path in chess_engine.py
   ```

4. **MPS performance issues:**
   - Ensure you're using M3 Pro (not M1/M2)
   - Check macOS version (12.0+ required)
   - Verify PyTorch MPS installation

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
