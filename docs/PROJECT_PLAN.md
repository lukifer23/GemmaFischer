# Project Plan: GemmaFischer â€” Chess LLM Engine + Tutor

## Summary

**GemmaFischer** is a lightweight language model (based on Gemma 3B or 270M) designed to function as both:

- A **chess engine**, capable of interfacing with UCI backends, evaluating positions, and suggesting moves
- A **chess tutor/analyst**, able to explain concepts, annotate games, and provide historical insight through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning

**Platform**: Mac-only (M3 Pro) with MPS acceleration - no CUDA/CPU fallbacks.

## Project Checklist

### Core LLM Development

- [ ] Start from *ChessGemma* (fine-tuned on PGNs) â†’ evolve as `GemmaFischer`
- [ ] Add **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning capability
  - Format: `[Position] â†’ Think step-by-step â†’ Evaluate threats â†’ Suggest best move`
- [ ] Train dual-purpose outputs:
  - `Tutor:` Mode with rich explanations
  - `Engine:` Mode with minimal fast UCI-style outputs
- [ ] Expand training data:
  - Annotated PGNs (Lichess Elite, King's Database)
  - Historical games: Fischer, Kasparov, AlphaZero
  - Theory books (openings, endgames, tactics)
- [ ] Format prompts to support style, reasoning, and role conditioning

---

### Training & Evaluation Objectives

  - Prompt tokens: `Style[Fischer]`, `Style[Aggressive]`, etc.

---

### UCI Backend Interfacing

- [ ] Implement adapter for UCI protocol compatibility
  - Input: UCI-style moves â†’ Output: bestmove

  ```plaintext
  <image:board.png>
  [FEN decoded internally]
  LLM: Analyzing current position...
  ```
- [ ] Use synthetic datasets:
  - Render images from PGNs to create paired training data

---

## Integrated Chess Knowledge Goals
