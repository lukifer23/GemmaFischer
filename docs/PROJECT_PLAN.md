# Project Plan: GemmaFischer — Chess LLM Engine + Tutor

## Summary

**GemmaFischer** is a lightweight language model (based on Gemma 3B or 270M) designed to function as both:

- A **chess engine**, capable of interfacing with UCI backends, evaluating positions, and suggesting moves
- A **chess tutor/analyst**, able to explain concepts, annotate games, and provide historical insight through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning

**Platform**: Mac-only (M3 Pro) with MPS acceleration - no CUDA/CPU fallbacks.

## Project Checklist

### Core LLM Development

- [x] Start from *ChessGemma* (fine-tuned on PGNs) → evolve as `GemmaFischer`

  - `Tutor:` Mode with rich explanations
  - `Engine:` Mode with minimal fast UCI-style outputs
- [x] Expand training data:
  - [x] Annotated PGNs (Lichess Elite, King's Database) - 5M+ puzzles processed

## Problems & Immediate Steps (Engine UCI Reliability)

### Problem Summary

- Current engine-mode outputs are frequently non-UCI or empty under greedy decoding. This indicates the model was not explicitly trained to produce strict UCI tokens for a FEN-only prompt and is copying/echoing prompts due to generic LM training on a single `text` field.

### Immediate Steps (Data)

- [ ] Create dedicated UCI supervision datasets with explicit instruction schema:
  - [ ] PGN-derived next-move pairs: walk through games and emit (FEN → next move in UCI).
  - [ ] Puzzles first-move supervision: use the first move of the puzzle solution.
  - [ ] Stockfish-labeled random positions: sample diverse FENs and label best move at depth 8–12.
  - [ ] Standardize JSONL schema: `{task, prompt, response, meta}` where:
    - `task`: `engine_uci` | `engine_pv` | `tutor_explain`
    - `prompt`: for engine `FEN: <fen>\nMove:`; for tutor `FEN: <fen>\nQuestion: <q>`
    - `response`: for engine exactly one UCI move (e.g., `e2e4`)
    - `meta`: `{fen, side, source, rating, label_source}`
- [ ] Implement/upgrade data scripts:
  - [ ] `scripts/extract_pgn_uci_pairs.py` (PGN → FEN/UCI pairs)
  - [ ] `scripts/build_engine_uci_supervision.py` (SF-labeled random FENs)
  - [ ] Extend `scripts/ingest_lichess_puzzles.py` to optionally emit the instruction schema above

### Immediate Steps (Training)

- [ ] Switch to instruction-style label masking (predict only the answer):
  - [ ] Add `InstructionDataCollator` that masks prompt tokens (labels = -100) and keeps labels for response tokens only
  - [ ] Update `train_lora_poc.py` to consume `{prompt, response, task}` and use the instruction collator
  - [ ] Extend `dataset_mixer.py` to accept both `text` and `{prompt/response/task}` schemas without forcing a `text` field
- [ ] Curriculum emphasizing engine formatting first, then difficulty:
  - [ ] Phase A: easy UCI (openings, mates-in-1, simple captures) — 80–90% engine
  - [ ] Phase B: general middlegame FENs (SF-labeled) — 70% engine
  - [ ] Phase C: tactics (puzzles 1200–2000) — 60% engine
  - [ ] Phase D: tutor explanations — 20–40% tutor
  - [ ] Add `configs/engine_tutor_curriculum.yaml` reflecting above ratios

### Immediate Steps (Inference/UCI)

- [ ] Normalize engine prompt to match training: `FEN: <fen>\nMove:`
- [ ] Remove duplicate `Position:` injection when a FEN is already supplied
- [ ] Deterministic decoding for engine mode: `do_sample=false`, `temperature=0`, `top_p=1`, `max_new_tokens=4` (5 for promotions)
- [ ] Strengthen UCI post-processing:
  - [ ] Regex clamp first token `^[a-h][1-8][a-h][1-8][qrbn]?$`
  - [ ] Validate legality against provided FEN; if illegal/missing, fallback to Stockfish

### Immediate Steps (Evaluation)

- [ ] Add syntax and legality metrics to all engine evals:
  - [ ] `uci_syntax_rate`: fraction of responses matching UCI regex
  - [ ] `uci_legal_rate`: fraction of UCI tokens legal in the given FEN
- [ ] A/B adapter evaluation:
  - [ ] Allow `--adapter_a` (baseline none) and `--adapter_b` (trained) in `aggregate_eval.py`
  - [ ] Report A/B for `uci_syntax_rate`, `uci_legal_rate`, and (optionally) `stockfish_top1`
- [ ] Log model info in eval outputs: base snapshot path, adapter path

### Optional (If UCI rate stagnates < 90%)

- [ ] Add special tokens for squares/promotions:
  - [ ] 64 square tokens `<sq_a1>.. <sq_h8>` and 4 promotion tokens `<promo_q|r|b|n>`
  - [ ] Emit 2–3 tokens per move (`from`, `to`, optional `promo`), post-process to canonical UCI
  - [ ] Resize embeddings safely with LoRA

### Milestones / KPIs

- [ ] Engine-mode (greedy) on 200 mixed FENs:
  - [ ] `uci_syntax_rate` ≥ 0.98
  - [ ] `uci_legal_rate` ≥ 0.95
- [ ] Stockfish top-1 match (depth 8) ≥ 0.25–0.35 on the same FEN set
- [ ] Tutor-mode remains coherent; no UCI artifacts in prose

- Voice assistant mode ("Coach Fischer, what's next?")
- Lichess or Chess.com API interface
- Export annotated PGNs or printable lessons
- Detect and critique user style: "Your midgame is often rushed…"

## Codebase Unification & Consistency

### Unification Checklist

- [ ] Prompt format (engine):
  - [ ] Standardize to `FEN: <fen>\nMove:` across code, web, and docs
  - [ ] Remove duplicate `Position:` injection in engine prompts
  - [ ] Update callers that currently embed `Position:` (web, eval scripts, docs examples)

- [ ] Central UCI parsing/validation:
  - [ ] Create `src/inference/uci_utils.py` with `extract_first_uci(text) -> Optional[str]` and `is_legal_uci(fen, uci) -> bool`
  - [ ] Replace local helpers in `src/evaluation/stockfish_match_eval.py`, `src/evaluation/puzzle_eval.py`, `src/inference/uci_bridge.py`, `src/web/app.py`, `src/web/stockfish_match.py`

- [ ] Deterministic engine decoding defaults:
  - [ ] Engine mode: `do_sample=false`, `temperature=0`, `top_p=1`, `max_new_tokens=4` (5 for promotions)
  - [ ] Add `do_sample` parameter to `ChessGemmaInference.generate_response` and set by mode

- [ ] Stockfish fallback policy:
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded fallback like `"e2e4"`
  - [ ] Enforce: extract UCI → legality check → on fail, fallback to Stockfish
  - [ ] Ensure UCI bridge and web endpoints follow the same policy

- [ ] Evaluation CLI unification:
  - [ ] Import `ChessGemmaInference` directly from `src.inference.inference` in eval scripts
  - [ ] Add `--adapter_a` (baseline none) and `--adapter_b` (trained) to A/B runners
  - [ ] Report `uci_syntax_rate`, `uci_legal_rate`, optional `stockfish_top1`
  - [ ] Include base snapshot and adapter path in reports

- [ ] Dataset schema & mixer:
  - [ ] Migrate builders to `{task, prompt, response, meta}` schema
  - [ ] Extend `dataset_mixer.py` to accept both legacy `text` and new instruction schema
  - [ ] Prefer instruction schema for future tasks

- [ ] Instruction collator & label masking:
  - [ ] Add `InstructionDataCollator` (mask prompt tokens: labels = -100)
  - [ ] Update training scripts to use the instruction collator

- [ ] Web/bridge integration:
  - [ ] Route engine queries via `ChessGemmaInference.generate_response(..., mode='engine')`
  - [ ] Use centralized UCI utils for extraction/legality
  - [ ] Ensure deterministic decode + fallback is applied everywhere

- [ ] Logging & debug controls:
  - [ ] Gate verbose inference logs behind `CHESSGEMMA_DEBUG=1`
  - [ ] Set `dataloader_pin_memory=False` on MPS, fix `datetime.utcnow()`

- [ ] Redundancy cleanup:
  - [ ] Archive/remove `src/web/stockfish_match.py` if superseded by eval tools
  - [ ] Audit and remove stale examples using `Position:` in code paths
