# ChessGemma Training Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the training process for ChessGemma's Mixture of Experts (MoE) system. The training uses LoRA fine-tuning with MPS optimization on Apple Silicon hardware.

**Platform**: Mac with Apple Silicon (M3/M4 recommended) - MPS acceleration optimized.
**Current Status**: 107K+ standardized training samples including 2K high-quality CoT reasoning examples.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Hardware**: Mac with Apple Silicon chip (M3/M4 recommended)
- **RAM**: 16GB+ (recommended for training)
- **Software**: Python 3.10+, PyTorch with MPS support
- **Storage**: 10GB+ free space for models and checkpoints
- **macOS**: 12.0+ (for MPS support)

### Installation
```bash
# Setup environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

### Available Datasets
ChessGemma uses standardized training data across three expert domains:

```bash
# Current dataset sizes (validated and processed)
data/standardized/standardized_uci_expert.jsonl:         50,000 samples (UCI move generation)
data/standardized/standardized_tutor_expert.jsonl:       50,000 samples (Chess explanations)
data/standardized/standardized_director_expert.jsonl:     5,133 samples (Q&A reasoning)
data/standardized/standardized_cot_reasoning_repaired.jsonl: 2,000 samples (CoT reasoning)
```

### Data Quality
- **Validation**: 100% move legality verification with Stockfish
- **CoT Quality**: Step-by-step reasoning validation with chess concept coverage
- **Format**: Standardized JSONL with consistent schema
- **Quality**: All samples validated with automated repair pipelines
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive chess positions and strategic scenarios
- **Integrity**: Real-time validation and corruption detection

## Training Commands

### Complete UCI Training (Recommended)
Use the enhanced training script for stable, monitored training:

```bash
# Complete UCI expert training with automatic checkpoint resumption and timeout protection
python scripts/train_uci_complete.py --max_steps 1600 --timeout_minutes 240
```

### Individual Expert Training
Train specific experts with enhanced stability features:

```bash
# UCI Expert (chess moves) - with timeout protection and resume capability
python -m src.training.train_lora_poc --expert uci --config auto --max_steps_override 1600 --timeout_minutes 240 --resume_from_checkpoint auto

# Tutor Expert (explanations) - with evaluation and progress monitoring
python -m src.training.train_lora_poc --expert tutor --config auto --max_steps_override 1000 --resume_from_checkpoint auto

# Director Expert (Q&A) - with comprehensive evaluation
python -m src.training.train_lora_poc --expert director --config auto --max_steps_override 1000
```

### Advanced Training Options

```bash
# Training with custom timeout and memory optimization
python -m src.training.train_lora_poc --expert uci --config auto --max_steps_override 2000 --timeout_minutes 360 --disable_eval

# Resume from specific checkpoint with progress monitoring
python -m src.training.train_lora_poc --expert tutor --resume_from_checkpoint checkpoints/lora_tutor/checkpoint-600 --timeout_minutes 300

# Quick smoke test training for validation
python -m src.training.train_lora_poc --expert director --config auto --max_steps_override 100 --timeout_minutes 30

# Training with custom evaluation frequency
python -m src.training.train_lora_poc --expert uci --config auto --max_steps_override 800 --eval_steps 50 --timeout_minutes 180
```
