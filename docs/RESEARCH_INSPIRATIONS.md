        self.model = model
        self.stockfish = stockfish
    
    def generate_with_tools(self, prompt):
        """Generate response with optional tool use"""
        # First, generate response
        response = self.model.generate(prompt)
        
        # Check if tool use is needed
        if self.needs_verification(response):
            # Use Stockfish to verify
            verification = self.stockfish.verify(response)
            if not verification.is_correct:
                # Regenerate with tool guidance
                response = self.model.generate(

- Find relevant opening theory
- Access annotated game commentary

**Implementation**:
```python
class ChessRAG:
    def __init__(self, embedding_model, vector_db):
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model
        self.vector_db = vector_db
    
    def retrieve_context(self, position, question):
        """Retrieve relevant context for position"""
        # Generate embedding for position
        position_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(position.fen())
        
        # Find similar positions
        similar_positions = self.vector_db.search(position_embedding, k=5)
        
        # Extract context
        context = []
        for pos in similar_positions:
            context.append(f"Similar position: {pos['fen']} - {pos['commentary']}")
        
        return context
```

### 2. Multi-Task Learning

**Concept**: Training on multiple related tasks improves performance

**Chess Applications**:

    """Create dataset with multiple chess tasks"""
    tasks = {
        'move_prediction': 0.3,
        'tactical_explanation': 0.25,
        'positional_analysis': 0.2,
        'opening_theory': 0.15,
        'endgame_technique': 0.1
    }
    
    # Mix tasks during training
    mixed_examples = []
    for task, weight in tasks.items():
        task_examples = load_task_data(task)
        num_examples = int(len(task_examples) * weight)
        mixed_examples.extend(task_examples[:num_examples])
    
    return mixed_examples
```

### 3. Style Conditioning

**Concept**: Conditioning model output on specific styles or personas

**Chess Applications**:

        'fischer': {
            'tone': 'aggressive',
            'focus': 'tactics',
            'examples': load_fischer_games()
        },
        'positional': {
            'tone': 'patient',
            'focus': 'strategy',
            'examples': load_positional_games()
        },
        'tutor': {
            'tone': 'educational',
            'focus': 'explanation',
