## Example Output
```
Let me analyze this position step by step:

1. Position Evaluation:
   - White has a slight space advantage
   - Black's king is exposed on the kingside
   - Both sides have active pieces

2. Key Threats and Opportunities:
   - White can attack the exposed black king
   - Black has some counterplay on the queenside
   - The center is contested

3. Candidate Moves:
   - Qh5: Direct attack on the king
   - Nf5: Centralizing the knight
   - O-O: Castling for safety

4. Best Move Reasoning:
   Qh5 is the most forcing move, directly attacking the black king and creating immediate threats. This move puts maximum pressure on Black and forces them to respond to the attack.

Best move: Qh5
